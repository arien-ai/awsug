# AWS User Group Getting Started Blog 💩
I'm stoked to present the AWS User Group website custom built blogging engine 🎉 using [AWS Amplify development platform](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and a couple of other AWS services in the background.

I'd like to walk you through the process of submitting your own content to the site. The process is quick and easy. All you need to get started is to register an account on this website, prepare your content using [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), and submit your draft for publication!

# AWS User Group Blogging 💩
> Estimated 5 minute read ⏱

Do you have something you'd like to share with a wider audience? We've got the perfect platform to publish your next AWS blog, article or poem using our fab website ❣️

Here's the steps to publish your content:
1. Register an account
2. Create a new blog in your personalised blogging portal
3. Manage your [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) content
4. Once you're ready, submit it for publication
5. We get back to you asap to let you know when it's published, or let you know why we thought it best not to (yet!)

> I apologise to everyone who had previously registered an account on the site. The AWS Cognito user pool was recreated during site upgrade. You'll have to register again in order to use the blogging engine 😔

# Blogging Portal
Sign into your account, then select BLOG from the top navigation bar. 

### Hit Create Blog

The new blog form requires you to agree to community standards before the form is activated. You need to provide a blog title, author name, link to any social media identity. Next, a blog summary of no more than 1000 characters. [The maximum size of a DynamoDB item is 400KB](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42181346/maximum-size-of-dynamodb-item).

### Write your content
Try using distraction free mode. To see an example, [download](https://awsug-image-bank.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/blog-1-getting-started/aws-ug-blog-1.md) portions of markdown for **this** blog.

Don't be shy now.

### Ready to publish 💕
Good to go? Hit Publish and confirm you're ready. No commitments for timeframes but we will get back to you asap :)

# Site admins
Members of the internal working committee can request to be added to the site admin user group. 

Let's say the site admin **Dullie** checks in. There might be nothing...

Unbeknownst to Dullie, in a different part of town, Ultradox is just finishing off his first blog for an eclectic user group[^1]. An hour later, Dullie gets an email notifying him a new blog has been submitted for review! He checks in to find a literary gem, makes sure the hyperlinks are kosher, then hits approve. Your blog goes live instantanously 🔥🔥🔥

[^1]: **eclectic**, philosophical word origin: denoting or belonging to a class of ancient philosophers who did not belong to or found any recognized school of thought but selected doctrines from various schools of thought.

Happy blogging XX
