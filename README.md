## Project setup
To run the project locally, you need [AWS Amplify CLI](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli). The project was deployed using AWS Amplify CLI version 4.18.1. You will have to run `amplify init` and use a profile to your own AWS account.
```
git clone...
npm install
amplify init...
amplify status
amplify push [to your own account]
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
