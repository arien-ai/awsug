## Project setup
To run the project locally, you need [AWS Amplify CLI](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli). The project was deployed using AWS Amplify CLI version 4.18.1. You will have to run `amplify init` and use a profile to your own AWS account.
```
git clone...
npm install
amplify init...
amplify status
amplify push [to your own account]
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

Restricting Access to Amazon S3 Content by Using an Origin Access Identity 

Did some further digging... amplify creates a CloudFront distribution... managed by AWS, and not visible in your account CloudFront console. Observe the Route 53 Alia record: d2*******8tg.cloudfront.net. After adding hosting with CloudFront and S3 with `amplify add hosting` I get dh*******4ob.cloudfront.net.

To manage access to the image bank served from an independent S3 bucket, setup new CloudFront distribution to front the image bank.

The next question: If Amplify manages the CloudFront distribution for the app, how is that configured?

## Ref: Question on StackOverflow

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61656125/aws-amplify-cli-cloudfront-s3-restrictions/61746792#61746792

When hosting a site with AWS S3 and CloudFront, it's possible to [restrict access to content that you serve from Amazon S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html). I want to restrict access to assets on S3 to my Amplify App (CDN).

Is it possible to achieve the same restriction with AWS Amplify? After deploying my AWS Amplify App, I don't see a CloudFront distribution. The documentation states: "The AWS Amplify Console leverages the Amazon CloudFront Global Edge Network to distribute your web app globally" ([FAQ, Hosting](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/faqs/)).

### Original Answer

I did some research and found it is possible to restrict access to S3 from a CloudFront distribution. In order to configure your CloudFront distribution using the Amplify CLI, add hosting: $ amplify add hosting

The relevant documentation is [here](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/hosting#using-aws-amplify-console); it states there are two overall categories of hosting:

    - Using AWS Amplify Console
    - Using S3 and CloudFront (prod stage)

In the past, I only ever used the Amplify Console to associate a custom domain to my app. I didn't understand why I couldn't find a CloudFront distribution. After running $ amplify add hosting and selecting:

    - Select the plugin module to execute: Amazon CloudFront and S3
    - Select the environment setup: PROD (S3 with CloudFront using HTTPS)

Followed by $ amplify publish. I waited about half an hour later and voila! There's now a CloudFront distribution fronting my web app, with Route 53 automatically configured ðŸ¤“
